Adapting Qwixx boardgame

Game creator: Steffen Benndor; illustraded by O. & S. Freudenreich

I like this game very much; from my perspective, adapting it for the web is a relevant exercise to learn/refresh about different languages.

## Version 1 (released)
Version 1 is a solo version where the goal is to enter the best scores list.

Open bugs:
- lock several lines during last turn;
- 2 or 3 three elegible cell in a row: unchecking 2^nd^ or 3^rd^ doesn't make the 1^st^ re-elegible

## Version 2
2 players on client side, show lock cell, show real-time score

## Version 3
2 players on server side, choose pen color for crossing cells

## Version 4
Up to 5 players on server side, choose different crossing-style (fill, hatch...), choose displaying elegibility or not
